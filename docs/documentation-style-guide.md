# Documentation Style Guide

## Purpose
This guide ensures all documentation is **concise, educational, and certification-focused**. The target audience is someone studying for AWS certifications who needs clear explanations of concepts without unnecessary verbosity.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Educational First**
- Explain **why** something is needed, not just how to do it
- Connect concepts to AWS certification topics
- Use real-world context when possible

### 2. **Concise and Direct**
- Get to the point quickly
- Remove unnecessary steps or explanations
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity
- Avoid repetitive or obvious information

### 3. **AWS Certification Focus**
- Reference relevant AWS services and concepts
- Explain IAM permissions in context of security best practices
- Connect features to AWS Well-Architected Framework principles
- Use AWS terminology consistently

## Structure Guidelines

### Document Headers
```markdown
# [Service/Feature] Setup Guide

## What This Does
Brief explanation of the purpose and AWS concepts involved.

## Prerequisites
- Only list what's actually required
- Include AWS CLI version if relevant

## Quick Start
Step-by-step instructions with explanations of each step.
```

### Code Examples
```bash
# Always explain what the command does
aws s3 mb s3://my-bucket --region us-east-1  # Creates S3 bucket
```

### IAM Policy Explanations
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",     // Read files from S3
                "s3:PutObject"      // Upload files to S3
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Content Guidelines

### What to Include
- **AWS concepts** and why they matter
- **Security implications** of each step
- **Cost considerations** where relevant
- **Best practices** with brief explanations
- **Common mistakes** to avoid

### What to Exclude
- Repetitive installation instructions
- Obvious troubleshooting steps
- Excessive command-line examples
- Marketing language or unnecessary context
- Step-by-step GUI instructions (prefer CLI)

### Writing Style
- Use active voice
- Be direct and clear
- Explain one concept at a time
- Use consistent terminology
- Include brief explanations for AWS services

## Template for New Documentation

```markdown

- Explain why they're important for certification

## Prerequisites
- Only essential requirements

## Setup Steps
1. **Step with explanation** - Why this matters
2. **Next step** - What AWS service this uses

## Testing
Quick verification commands with explanations.

## Security Notes
Key security considerations and best practices.

## Troubleshooting
Only common, non-obvious issues.
```

## Examples of Good vs. Bad Documentation

### ❌ Bad: Verbose and Unclear
```markdown
# Setting Up AWS CLI

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the entire process of installing and configuring the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your local machine. The AWS CLI is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with various AWS services directly from your terminal or command prompt.

## Installation Instructions

### For macOS Users
If you're using a Mac computer, you have several options for installing the AWS CLI. The easiest method is to use Homebrew, which is a popular package manager for macOS.

First, make sure you have Homebrew installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once Homebrew is installed, you can install the AWS CLI by running:

```bash
brew install awscli
```

Alternatively, you can download the official AWS CLI installer from the AWS website...
```

### ✅ Good: Concise and Educational
```markdown
# AWS CLI Setup

## What This Does
AWS CLI lets you manage AWS services from command line. Essential for automation and AWS certification exams.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ (required for AWS CLI v2)

## Installation
```bash
# macOS
brew install awscli

# Linux
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

## Configuration
```bash
aws configure  # Sets up credentials and default region
```

**What this does**: Creates `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config` files for authentication.

## Test Setup
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity  # Shows your AWS account info
```

## Security Note
Never commit AWS credentials to version control. Use IAM roles when possible.
```

## Checklist for New Documentation

Before publishing any documentation, ensure it:

- [ ] Explains **why** each step matters
- [ ] Uses AWS terminology correctly
- [ ] Connects to certification concepts
- [ ] Is concise (under 500 words for simple guides)
- [ ] Includes security considerations
- [ ] Has clear, testable examples
- [ ] Avoids unnecessary verbosity
- [ ] Focuses on CLI over GUI instructions

## Updating Existing Documentation

When updating existing docs:

1. **Remove** redundant explanations
2. **Add** AWS concept explanations
3. **Simplify** step-by-step instructions
4. **Focus** on educational value
5. **Maintain** security and best practice notes

## Example: Converting Existing Docs

### Before (Verbose)
```markdown
# IAM User Setup for AWS S3 Sync Application

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the entire process of creating an IAM user with programmatic access for your AWS S3 sync application using the AWS CLI. This is a crucial step in setting up secure access to your AWS resources and ensuring that your sync application can operate with the appropriate permissions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this setup process, you'll need to ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **AWS CLI Installed**: Make sure you have AWS CLI installed and configured on your local machine or server
2. **Administrative Access**: Your AWS account must have permissions to create IAM users and policies
3. **S3 Bucket**: You'll need a bucket name for your sync operations
```

### After (Concise and Educational)
```markdown
# IAM User Setup

## What This Does
Creates an IAM user with minimal S3 permissions for sync operations. Demonstrates AWS security best practices.

## AWS Concepts
- **IAM Users**: Identity for programmatic access
- **IAM Policies**: JSON documents defining permissions
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Granting minimal required access

## Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with admin access
- S3 bucket name (globally unique)

## Quick Setup
```bash
python scripts/setup-iam-user.py --bucket-name my-sync-bucket
```

**What this creates**:
- IAM user with S3 sync permissions
- Access keys for programmatic access
- CloudWatch monitoring permissions
```

## Final Notes

- **Keep it educational**: Every piece of documentation should teach something about AWS
- **Be concise**: Remove unnecessary words and steps
- **Focus on concepts**: Explain the "why" behind each step
- **Use consistent formatting**: Follow the templates provided
- **Test your documentation**: Ensure all commands work as written

This style guide ensures all documentation serves the dual purpose of helping users accomplish tasks while learning AWS concepts for certification.
