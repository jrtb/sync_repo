# Usage Guide: AWS S3 Sync System

## What This Guide Covers

Complete walkthrough of using the AWS S3 Sync System from initial setup through regular operations and maintenance. This guide demonstrates real-world AWS service integration for educational and practical purposes.

## AWS Concepts Demonstrated

- **IAM**: User creation, policy management, credential security
- **S3**: Object storage, storage classes, lifecycle policies, encryption
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring, logging, metrics collection
- **Security**: Access control, encryption, audit trails
- **Cost Management**: Storage optimization, lifecycle policies

## Initial Setup

### Step 1: Create IAM User and S3 Bucket

**Why**: IAM users provide secure, programmatic access to AWS services with minimal permissions.

```bash
# Create IAM user with minimal S3 permissions
python scripts/setup-iam-user.py --bucket-name my-sync-bucket

# This creates:
# - IAM user with S3 access permissions
# - S3 bucket with encryption and versioning
# - CloudWatch monitoring permissions
# - Secure credential storage
```

**AWS Learning**: IAM follows the principle of least privilege - users get only the permissions they need.

### Step 2: Verify Setup and Credentials

**Why**: Validation ensures everything works correctly before proceeding.

```bash
# Test AWS credentials and permissions
python scripts/test-credentials.py

# Comprehensive setup verification
python scripts/verify-production-setup.py

# Expected output: All verification checks passed
```

**AWS Learning**: Always validate credentials and permissions before operations.

### Step 3: Initialize Project Structure

**Why**: Proper project structure enables configuration management and organization.

```bash
# Initialize project directories and configurations
python scripts/setup.py --init

# This creates:
# - Configuration files with defaults
# - Directory structure for logs and data
# - Environment-specific configurations
```

**AWS Learning**: Configuration management is crucial for production systems.

## Regular Operations

### Daily Sync Workflow

#### Step 1: Validate Current Setup

**Why**: Regular validation prevents issues during sync operations.

```bash
# Comprehensive system validation
python scripts/validate.py --all

# This checks:
# - AWS credentials and connectivity
# - S3 bucket access and permissions
# - Configuration file integrity
# - System resources and requirements
```

#### Step 2: Preview Sync Operation

**Why**: Dry-run mode shows what will happen without making changes.

```bash
# Preview sync operation
python scripts/sync.py --local-path ./photos --dry-run

# This shows:
# - Files that will be uploaded
# - Files that will be skipped (already in sync)
# - Storage class assignments
# - Estimated upload time
```

**AWS Learning**: Always test operations before making changes in production.

#### Step 3: Execute Sync Operation

**Why**: Actual sync uploads files with progress tracking and error handling.

```bash
# Execute sync operation
python scripts/sync.py --local-path ./photos

# This provides:
# - Real-time progress updates
# - Concurrent uploads for performance
# - Error handling and retry logic
# - Detailed logging for troubleshooting
```

**AWS Learning**: S3 supports multipart uploads for large files and concurrent operations.

### Storage Optimization

#### Analyze Storage Costs

**Why**: Understanding storage costs helps optimize spending.

```bash
# Analyze current storage costs
python scripts/storage-class-manager.py --analyze-costs

# This shows:
# - Current storage class distribution
# - Cost breakdown by storage class
# - Potential savings from optimization
# - Usage patterns and recommendations
```

**AWS Learning**: S3 storage classes have different costs and access patterns.

#### Optimize Storage Classes

**Why**: Automatic optimization reduces costs while maintaining access patterns.

```bash
# Preview storage optimizations
python scripts/storage-class-manager.py --optimize-storage --dry-run

# Apply optimizations
python scripts/storage-class-manager.py --optimize-storage

# This:
# - Moves infrequently accessed files to cheaper storage
# - Applies lifecycle policies automatically
# - Maintains access patterns for frequently used files
# - Provides cost savings with minimal impact
```

**AWS Learning**: Lifecycle policies automatically transition objects between storage classes.

## Maintenance Operations

### Backup and Recovery

#### Create Backups

**Why**: Regular backups protect against data loss and enable disaster recovery.

```bash
# Create local backup
python scripts/backup.py --local

# Create S3 backup (encrypted)
python scripts/backup.py --s3

# This creates:
# - Compressed backup of configurations
# - Encrypted backup in S3
# - Backup metadata and verification
# - Retention policy management
```

**AWS Learning**: S3 provides reliable, encrypted storage for backup data.

#### Restore from Backup

**Why**: Restore capabilities enable recovery from data loss or corruption.

```bash
# List available backups
python scripts/backup.py --list

# Restore from local backup
python scripts/restore.py --from-backup backup-2024-01-15.tar.gz

# Restore from S3 backup
python scripts/restore.py --from-s3

# This:
# - Downloads and extracts backup data
# - Verifies data integrity
# - Restores configurations and settings
# - Provides rollback capabilities
```

**AWS Learning**: Data integrity verification is crucial for reliable backups.

### System Maintenance

#### Cleanup Operations

**Why**: Regular cleanup prevents disk space issues and maintains system performance.

```bash
# Clean up temporary files
python scripts/cleanup.py --temp-files

# Clean up old backups
python scripts/cleanup.py --old-backups

# Clean up old logs
python scripts/cleanup.py --old-logs

# Run all cleanup operations
python scripts/cleanup.py --all
```

**AWS Learning**: Automated maintenance reduces operational overhead.

#### System Validation

**Why**: Regular validation ensures system health and identifies issues early.

```bash
# Comprehensive system validation
python scripts/validate.py --all

# Validate specific components
python scripts/validate.py --config    # Configuration files
python scripts/validate.py --credentials # AWS credentials
python scripts/validate.py --permissions # File permissions
python scripts/validate.py --network   # Network connectivity
```

**AWS Learning**: Proactive monitoring prevents issues before they impact operations.

## Advanced Operations

### Configuration Management

#### Validate Configurations

**Why**: Configuration validation prevents errors and ensures consistency.

```bash
# Validate current configuration
python config/config_manager.py --validate

# Show configuration information
python config/config_manager.py --info
